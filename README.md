The crypto project I worked on was built using an existing template design. It was a valuable opportunity for me to enhance my skills and gain practical experience in working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while developing a fully responsive and accessible landing page.
The web page I created for the crypto project is hosted and can be accessed through the following link: https://yarychok.github.io/crypto/. Feel free to visit the page to see the project in action.
